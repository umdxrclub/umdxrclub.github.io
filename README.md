# UMD XR Club Website

## About

This is the repo for the UMD XR Club's website. This project was created using the popular [facebook/create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The website is mostly static with no backend, and primarily utilizes react function components for organization. The content of each section of the website is defined in the src/XR_CONSTANTS.js file.

The app is hosted with GitHub Actions.

## Building Locally

I would recommend that you make sure things build and look fine locally before committing a significant change. Here is how you might want to establish an environment for doing that:
* Clone repo on computer
* Ensure that npm is installed on the computer
* npm i
* npm start
